Easy audio is (or actually, will be ;) my pack of audio decoders. It can
help you decode audio files and also provides easy access to metadata.
Currently only flac decoder is available and there are some stubs on wav
format too.

Currently implemented: flac, wav (partially)
Planned: ape, wavpack

There is no unified API for all decodecs yet
